OCS (Open Computers and Software Inventory Next Generation) is an asset management and deployment solution.
Since 2001, OCS Inventory NG has been looking for ways to make software and hardware more powerful.
OCS Inventory NG asks its agents to know the software and hardware composition of every computer or server.

<h2 align="center">Project state</h2>
<p align='justify'>
OCS Inventory NG has been looking for ways to make software and hardware more powerful.

OCS Inventory NG 2.X has been around since 2012. The OCS Inventory Team is pleased to announce that we are working on a major redesign of the product to use a more modern structure and technologies.
</p>

<h2 align="center">What's coming next</h2>
<p align='justify'>
OCS Inventory 3.0 will introduce an all-new technology stack in the product to extend your (asset) inventory capabilities and have a better integration with third-party software.

Since the start of this year, we have been creating blogs to communicate on the subject; they are currently only available in French but will be translated soon into English to make them available to everyone.

We are aiming to provide the following major changes: 
- an API-based backend to ease the import / export process from the application
- a model-based inventory system to allow changing the inventory structure and data directly from the server without any code
- network and computer asset type unification in the data model â€” SNMP and network information won't be separated as in the 2.X version
- a completely reworked web interface with a more user-friendly design
- a dedicated agent for network devices in order to improve SNMP data inventory and scanning
- rewritten documentation to ease the installation and administration of the application
</p>

<h2 align="center">Release timeline</h2>
<p align='justify'>
We are aiming to provide a first viable/market-ready version by the end of 2025.

This version will implement everything from 2.0 with a backward compatibility module to allow old agents to inventory themselves on the new infrastructure.

The following features won't be present in the first version and are scheduled for release in the 3.1 / 3.2 versions: 
- Extension / plugin engine
- CVE inventory
- Green IT

This decision has been made because we need to rework these features thoroughly to provide you with the best experience.

We are excited to see you try the next OCS Inventory version and its new UI and features.
